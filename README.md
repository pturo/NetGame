## What's new?

There is no new features.

## About project

Demo multiplayer game made with Unity3D. It only shows that you can join to game as a host and in separate window as a player. This is only example of implementing simple multiplayer functionality and this is definitely NOT a playable game.

To run this game, you have to run it with two separate windows. First window will be local host, second will be our player like on the screen below.
